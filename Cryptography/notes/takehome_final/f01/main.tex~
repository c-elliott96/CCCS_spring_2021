The following says that you can perform
left or right \lq\lq cancellation'' of similar terms
in an addition.
 
\begin{thm} \mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0in]
\item[(a)] 
If 
\[
a + x = a + y
\]
then
\[
x = y
\]
\item[(b)]
If 
\[
x + a = y + a
\]
then
\[
x = y
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

By now this one is way too easy for an assignment questions.
You can try to prove this on your own.

\newpage

There's also a multiplicative version of cancellation:

\begin{thm} \mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0in]
\item[(a)] 
If
\[ 
ax = ay, \,\,\, a \neq 0
\]
then
\[
x = y
\]
\item[(b)]
If
\[ 
xa = ya, \,\,\, a \neq 0
\]
then
\[
x = y
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Q1. Prove Theorem 10

\SOLUTION

\input{q1.tex}

\newpage

{\bf Divisors}

Let $m, n \in \Z$.
We say that $m$ divides $n$ is you find some $x \in \Z$ such that 
\[
mx = n
\]
For instance $m=6$ divides $n=42$ since for $x = 7$ we do have $6x = 42$.

Instead of saying \lq\lq $m$ divides $n$'', for simplicity, we will
write $m \mid n$.

We add the following \lq\lq writing rules''.
Note that these are definitions and not properties.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=\LISTMARGIN]
\item[DIV1:] $d \mid a$ can be replaced by [$dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$]
\item[DIV2:] [$dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$] can be replaced by $d \mid a$ 
\end{enumerate}

Note that there is a \lq\lq for some'' in the definition.
The statement
\[
\lq\lq dx = a \text{ for some } x \in \Z"
\]
is the same as
\[
\lq\lq \text{there is some } x \in \Z \text{ such that } dx = a"
\]
which is of course the same as 
\[
\lq\lq \text{there exists some } x \in \Z \text{ such that } dx = a"
\]
They all mean the same thing.
Of course you know that there's a symbol for \lq\lq there exists some'': 
$\exists$.
So the above 3 statements are written more formally as
\[
\exists x \in \Z (dx = a)
\]
You don't see the \lq\lq such that''.
Some authors use a dot for \lq\lq such that'':
\[
\exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a)
\]
If the system (or the \lq\lq universe of discourse'') is known and fixed
throughout, which for our case is $\Z$, then one usually just write
\[
\exists x \cdot (dx = a)
\]

More formally I could have written:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=\LISTMARGIN]
\item[DIV1:] $d \mid a$ can be replaced by [$\exists x \in \Z (dx = a)$]
\item[DIV2:] [$\exists x \in \Z (dx = a)]$ can be replaced by $d \mid a$ 
\end{enumerate}


I will usually avoid too many symbols and try to use more English words.
So I will usually not use $\exists$.
Too many abstract symbols actually prevents understanding for most students.
I'll stick to
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=\LISTMARGIN]
\item[DIV1:] $d \mid a$ can be replaced by [$dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$]
\item[DIV2:] [$dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$] can be replaced by $d \mid a$ 
\end{enumerate}


Although in the above I said 
\lq\lq $\exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a)$'' 
and
\lq\lq $dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$'' 
are the same,
in fact in formal logic they are different.
When you go from
\lq\lq $\exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a)$''
to
\lq\lq $dx = a$ for some $x \in \Z$''
you are doing something called \lq\lq existential instantiation'':
\begin{align*}
           & \exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a) \\
\THEREFORE & dx_1 = a \text{ for some } x_1 \in \Z & & \text{by existential instantiation}
\end{align*}
If you go from
\lq\lq $dx_1 = a$ for some $x_1 \in \Z$''
to
\lq\lq $\exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a)$''
you're doing something called \lq\lq existential generalization'':
\begin{align*}
           & dx_1 = a \text{ for some } x_1 \in \Z  \\
\THEREFORE & \exists x \in \Z \cdot (dx = a) & & \text{by existential generalization}
\end{align*}
In order not to be bogged down with details, I will treat the two 
as synonymous.
Remember that they are actually considered different things in 
formal logic.

Here are some of the deduction rules you can use when working with
\lq\lq for some'' (i.e. when working with $\exists$.)
First suppose $P(y)$ is a predicate (think of this as a boolean formula)
that involves a boolean variable $y$ and not $x$.
Then you can do this:
\begin{align*}
           & \exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (P(y))) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists y \cdot (P(y)) \\
\end{align*}
In other words you can remove the \lq\lq $\exists x$'' if the stuff
after it does not involve $x$ at all.
Likewise if say $P$ has nothing to do with $x$, then you can 
make the following deduction:
\begin{align*}
           & \exists x \cdot (P) \\
\THEREFORE & P \\
\end{align*}
For instance suppose you are given the statement 
\lq\lq $\exists x \cdot (1+1 = 2)$'', 
then you can make the following deduction:
\begin{align*}
           & \exists x \cdot (1+1=2) \\
\THEREFORE & 1+1=2 \\
\end{align*}
Here's another example:
\begin{align*}
           & \exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (2 \times 3 = 1000)) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists y \cdot (2 \times 3 = 1000) \\
\THEREFORE & 2 \times 3 = 1000 \\
\end{align*}
I'm not saying that \lq\lq$2 \times 3 = 1000$'' is true.
I'm saying {\it if} you're given the statement
\lq\lq $\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (2 \times 3 = 1000))$'',
you can infer
\lq\lq$2 \times 3 = 1000$''.
Garbage-in-garbage-out, right?

The above gives you the logic inference rule for removing $\exists$.

Here's another logic inference rule you can do.
In this case you have the opposite.
The rule gives you the right to introduce $\exists$.
Suppose $P(x)$ is a predicate again.
Suppose also that there is a value in your domain, say $c$, such that
$P(c)$ is true.
Then you can make this inference:
\begin{align*}
           & P(c) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists x \cdot (P(x))
\end{align*}
For instance let $P(x)$ be the statement
\lq\lq $2x = 6$''.
Of course you know that $2 \times 3 = 6$, i.e., $P(3)$ is true.
You can therefore make the following inference:
\begin{align*}
           & 2 \times 3 = 6 \\
\THEREFORE & \exists x \cdot (2 \times x = 6) 
\end{align*}
That's all there is to it.
As another example, let me continue the above:
\begin{align*}
           & 2 \times 3 = 6 \\
\THEREFORE & \exists x \cdot (2 \times x = 6) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists y \cdot (\exists x \cdot (2 \times x = y))
\end{align*}



If $d$ is not a divisor of $a$, we write 
\[
d \nmid a
\]

In the following theorems, $a, b, c, x, y$ are integers.

\newpage

\begin{thm}
$1 \mid n$.
\end{thm}

\proof 
We have
\begin{align*}
           & 1n = n & & \text{by RING16} \\
\THEREFORE & 1x = n \text{ for some $x \in \Z$ (for instance when $x = n \in \Z$)} \\
\THEREFORE & 1 \mid n & & \text{by DIV2} 
\end{align*}
\qed

If I want to be even more formal I would write
\begin{align*}
           & 1n = n                   & & \text{by RING16} \\
\THEREFORE & \exists x \cdot (1x = n) & & \text{by existential generalization}\\
\THEREFORE & 1 \mid n                 & & \text{by DIV2} 
\end{align*}

\newpage

\begin{thm} \mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0in]
\item[(a)] $a \mid a$. 
\item[(b)] If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

(a) says that $\mid$ is a \lq\lq reflexive relation'' while 
(b) says that $\mid$ is a \lq\lq transitive relation''.
What's a relation? You can think of a relation as a boolean function.
For instance the = on $\Z \times \Z$ is a relation.
\begin{align*}
(1=2) &= \false \\
(2=2) &= \true \\
\end{align*}

\proof
(a) Exercise.

(b) We have
\begin{align*}
           & a \mid b \\
\THEREFORE & ax = b \text{ for some $x \in \Z$} & & \tag{1}
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
           & b \mid c \\
\THEREFORE & by = c \text{ for some $y \in \Z$} & & \tag{2}
\end{align*}
Altogether we have, for some $x \in \Z$ and $y \in \Z$,
\begin{align*}
              ax &= b  & & \text{by (1)}\\
           (ax)y &= by \\
                 &= c  & & \text{by (2)}\\
\THEREFORE a(xy) &= c  & & \text{by RING12} \\
\THEREFORE    az &= c  \text{ for some $z \in \Z$ (i.e. $z = xy \in \Z$)}
                       & & \text{by RING11}
\end{align*}
\qed

You can of course combine the above like this:
\begin{align*}
                 &a \mid b, \,\,\, b \mid c \\
\THEREFORE ax    &= b \text{ for some $x \in \Z$}, \,\,\, 
           by = c \text{ for some $y \in \Z$}  \tag{1,2}\\
\THEREFORE (ax)y &= by \text{ for some $x \in \Z, y \in \Z$} \\
                 &= c  & & \text{by (1) and (2)}\\
\THEREFORE a(xy) &= c  \text{ for some $x \in \Z, y \in \Z$}  & & \text{by RING12} \\
\THEREFORE    az &= c  \text{ for some $z \in \Z$ (i.e. $z = xy \in \Z$)}  
                       & & \text{by RING11}\\
\THEREFORE       &a \mid c
\end{align*}
But it's harder to follow if you put too many facts on the same line.

If I really want to be formal, I can do this using the $\exists$ notation:
\begin{align*}
           &a \mid b, \,\,\, b \mid c \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (ax = b)), \,\,\,  (\exists y \cdot (by = c)) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)= b, by = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)y= by, by = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)y = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (a(xy) = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (a(xy) = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (\exists z \cdot (z = xy,  az = c)))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (\exists z \cdot (az = c)))) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists y \cdot (\exists z \cdot (az = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists z \cdot (az = c) \\
\THEREFORE & a \mid c
\end{align*}
Also in formal logic we should use $\land$ for our comma.
So to be really formal I would write
\begin{align*}
           & (a \mid b) \land (b \mid c) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (ax = b)) \land  (\exists y \cdot (by = c)) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)= b \land by = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)y= by \land by = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot ((ax)y = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (a(xy) = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (a(xy) = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot 
              (\exists y \cdot 
               (\exists z \cdot (z = xy \land az = c)))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists x \cdot (\exists y \cdot (\exists z \cdot (az = c)))) \\
\THEREFORE & (\exists y \cdot (\exists z \cdot (az = c))) \\
\THEREFORE & \exists z \cdot (az = c) \\
\THEREFORE & a \mid c
\end{align*}
