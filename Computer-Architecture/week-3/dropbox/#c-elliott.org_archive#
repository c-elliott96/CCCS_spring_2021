1. Ref. problem 8.16
   1. A DMA cycle could take as long as \( \SI{750}{\nano}s \) without the need for
      wait states. This corresponds to a clock period of \( \SI{750}{\nano}s / 3
      = \SI{250}{\nano}s \), which in turn corresponds to a clock rate of about
      \( \SI{4}{\mega\hertz} \). This approach would reduce power consumption.

2. Ref. problems 8.17a and 8.17b

   1. Telecommunications links can operate continuously by their nature, so
      burst mode can't be used. Cycle-stealing is then necessary.

   2. All the links of DMA channels have the same data rate, so they must
      be given equal priority, or you won't be maximizing the throughput
      potential.
