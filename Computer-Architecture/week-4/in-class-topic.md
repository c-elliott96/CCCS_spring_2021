## Christian - 13.10 What is meant by the term _nesting of procedures_?

* Procedures are essentially callable (quickly addressed) sub-programs. 

* Procedures can call other procedures. That is, they can invoke a separate procedure
  within its own execution. 
  
  * Becuase of this, procedures can nest to an arbitrary depth.
